# XMM mock data simulator

A Python package to generate mock XMM-Newton images and spectra from 3D galaxy cluster simulations from hydrodynamical simulations. The tool generates particle background spectra from filter-wheel-closed data, a realistic sky background model, energy-dependent vignetting, energy redistribution, and PSF convolution.
